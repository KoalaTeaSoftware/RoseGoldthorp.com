        <p>Hello, I am Rose Goldthorp. I was born in 1998. This is me at the Auckland zoo., and what you see here as a
            kind of vlog that I have been putting together since I was 10. For more recent stuff, use the nav bar.
        </p>
        <p> I have always been interested in films for as long as I can remember. It started as the usual enjoyment of
            entertainment, but I loved watching the set-ups and other features on the DVDs. The organisation, hard work
            and fun that went into making films had me goggling for hours.
        </p>
        <p> To make most of these, I used Sony handycams (first with minDV and now fully digital) and Sony Vegas to make
            AVI versions and then used the Flash 8 video encoders to squash them right down for the web, so don't be
            upset by the graininess and the aspect ratio.
        </p>
        <p> For my feature films, however, I have a bigger camera, now: a Panasonic (from all my birthday and Christmas
            presents combined forever!).

                                <strong>feature-film number 2</strong>, to be shot this coming summer. The Synopsis
                                (under its working title) and Treatment are here together with the first draft of the
                                screenplay. It is a 19th century costume drama (aargh!). The location owners are really
                                very kind though and are giving me a go.

                    <p>I started off writing a script for a film called the Moon-dragon’s daughter. At first, my actors
                        were going to help and we got some shots, but then one had family problems, and others told me
                        that they were too busy. In the end, I got so down about it that I gave up on it and started
                        another script (Marooned). I've also put up another couple of pieces of work I've done for
                        school and a charity

                    <p>I wanted to make a film with my school friends during the summer holidays. I wrote one but I
                        didn't like it. It never even deserved a title (so it is called 'script one'). My second script
                        Les Trois Fees (the three fairies) was better, so I started filming. Unfortunately, my cast kept
                        mucking about - they enjoyed the dressing-up, but wouldn't do the script properly, so I had to
                        give up on it.

                        into the side of. My mum was really careful of it, but I managed to borrow it while we on
                        holiday in the Yorkshire Dales and point it at the scenery. I was unable to get the cast to do
                        anything but walk around a bit and eat the grass. The next time I was allowed to play with it
                        was walking down the lane near home.

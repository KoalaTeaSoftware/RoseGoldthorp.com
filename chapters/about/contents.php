        <p>Hello people ... just a bit about me:</p>
        <p>I recently graduated from the University of Auckland, NZ, with a BA in Marketing and Communications with TV
            and
            Film. I have made five feature films and over 18 shorts in my spare time while at school and university.

        <p>After graduating in 2020, I immigrated back to the UK, and launched my transmedia website,
            <a href="https://the-greenlands.com/" target="_blank">The Greenlands</a>, for which (along with soc. med.
            platforms) I draw, write, upload and record my
            fantasy drama podcast; art work; digital storyboards (of the Greenlands films); illustrated blogs;
            short films; and cartoon strips and affiliate “shops”.
        </p>
        <p>In 2020, I launched <a href="https://thedailydilettante.com/" target="_blank">The Wessex Dramas Project</a>
            with my co-writer, and in this, each year, we make one 'No/Lo Budget' feature film and two podcast seasons
            of Thomas Hardy stories.
        </p>
        <p>In 2023, I also launched <a href="https://scottland.org/" target="_blank">The Scottland Dramas Project</a>
            with my co-writer and in this project, each year, we make one 'No/Lo Budget' feature film and two podcast
            seasons of Sir Walter Scott's stores.

        <p>I hope to make the feature film versions of my Greenlands Cycle as animations. I also want to direct the
            period Brit. lit. feature / podcast scripts that I have co-written as live action films, whenever a producer
            can find these films
            some investments. Meanwhile, lots of you lovely people are helping me, on a voluntary, collaborative basis,
            to get
            these scripts out into the world as podcasts, and no budget features.

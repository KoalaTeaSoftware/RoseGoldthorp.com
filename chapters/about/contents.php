        <p>Hello people ... just a bit about me:</p>
        <p>I recently graduated from the University of Auckland, NZ, with a BA in Marketing and Communications with TV
            and
            Film. I have made five feature films and over 18 shorts in my spare time while at school and university.

        <p>After graduating in 2020, I immigrated back to the UK, and launched my transmedia website,
            <a href="https://the-greenlands.com/" target="_blank">The Greenlands</a>, for which (along with soc. med.
            platforms) I draw, write, upload and record my
            fantasy drama podcast; art work; digital storyboards (of the Greenlands films); illustrated blogs;
            short films; and cartoon strips and affiliate “shops”. </p>
        <p>I have also just launched my second transmedia
            website about the other half of my work: period Brit. lit. films. From the new year (2022) onwards, I will
            also be starting a podcast series on this project's web site
            <a href="https://thedailydilettante.com/" target="_blank">The Daily Dilettante</a>

        <p>I hope to make the feature film versions of my Greenlands Cycle as animations. I also want to direct the
            period Brit. lit. scripts I have co-written as live action films, whenever a producer can find these films
            some investments. Meanwhile, lots of you lovely people are helping me, on a collaborative basis, to get
            these scripts out into the world as podcasts.</p>

        <p>I am the Writer / Director for Swords and Clapboards.</p>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Auckland, NZ, with a BA in Marketing and Communications with TV and
            Film. I have made five feature films and over 18 shorts in my spare time while at school and university.

        <p>After graduating in February 2020, I immigrated back to the UK, and launched my transmedia website,
            the-greenlands.com, for which (along with soc. med. platforms) I draw, write, upload and record my
            fantasy drama podcast; art work; digital storyboards (of the Greenlands films); illustrated blogs;
            short films; and cartoon strip; affiliate “shops”; and soon, an accumulating collection of
            Greenlands-themed mobile entertainment apps (Oracles) which I co-wrote and part shot.

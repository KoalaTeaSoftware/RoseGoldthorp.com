        <p>I have just launched another transmedia project:
            <a href="https://thedailydilettante.com/" target="_blank">The Daily Dilettante</a>. Again involving various
            social media platforms and also, eventually, its own web site, as the project's own 'mother ship'. Podcasts
            will start in the new year.

        <p>I am busy co-adapting various period Brit lit novels (I have already co-adapted 3) with a view, eventually,
            to
            making these adaptations as films and TV mini-series.
        </p>
        <p>I am concentrating on Thomas Hardy's three Novels of Ingenuity, and the last three of Trollope's Barchester
            Chronicles, at the moment.

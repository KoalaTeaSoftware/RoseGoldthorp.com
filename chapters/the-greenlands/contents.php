            In 2020, I started a transmedia project to gain interest in my next cycle of six comic fantasy feature
            films, set in The Greenlands (my own story-world). I wrote the stories and treatments, and then co-wrote the
            six screenplays.

        <p class="mt-3">On the <a href="https://the-greenlands.com" target="_blank"> web site</a>, you can listen to the
            podcasts of these features. Shortly, in early 2021, I will record the fourth feature in this cycle, "The
            Battle of the Ley Lines"
